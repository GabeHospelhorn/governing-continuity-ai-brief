Governance brief on continuity as a boundary condition in AI systems


# Governing Continuity in AI Systems — Governance Brief (v1.0)

This repository hosts a short governance brief that isolates a structural failure mode observed across AI systems: continuity becoming implicitly trusted across time, context, and authority.

The brief is pre-architectural and diagnostic. It does not propose a framework, model, or safety mechanism. It defines a boundary condition and an inspection question that can be applied across AI governance, safety, infrastructure, and evaluation contexts.

**Design orientation**  
Security improves when continuity becomes expensive, not when attackers become rare.

**Inspection question**  
Is continuity behaving as governed, or is it silently amortizing?

This document makes no claims of safety, validation, or adoption. It is published for inspection and reference.
